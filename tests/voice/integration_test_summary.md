## Test Infrastructure and Utilities

### Test Fixtures and Mocks

**Audio Data Generation:**

    """Generate sample WAV audio data for testing."""
    # Creates 1-second WAV file with sine wave at 440Hz
    # Proper WAV format with headers for realistic testing
```

**Component Mocking:**
```python
@pytest.fixture
async def voice_manager(self):
    """Create and initialize a voice manager for testing."""
    # Mocks external dependencies (VRAM, integrations)
    # Provides clean initialization and cleanup
```

**Realistic Test Data:**
```python
@pytest.fixture

    """Create a sample voice message for testing."""
    # Complete VoiceMessage with audio, text, and metadata
```
