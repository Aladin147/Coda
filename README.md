## 🎯 Vision

Coda is evolving from a voice assistant into a **comprehensive digital operator** that can:

- 🗣️ **Real-time voice interaction** with sub-second latency
- 🧠 **Advanced memory systems** with long-term learning
- 🎭 **Adaptive personality** that learns from user feedback  
- 🔧 **Extensible tool ecosystem** for complex task execution
- 🔒 **Privacy-first design** with local processing
- 🌐 **Multi-modal capabilities** (voice, text, vision planned)

## ⚡ Key Features

### **Real-Time Voice Processing**
- **Streaming STT/TTS** with Kyutai integration (planned)
- **Semantic Voice Activity Detection** for natural conversation flow
- **Interruption handling** with precise resume capabilities
- **Voice cloning** from short audio samples

### **Intelligent Memory System**
- **Short-term memory** for conversation context
- **Long-term memory** with vector embeddings and semantic search
- **Memory consolidation** across sessions
- **User preference learning** and adaptation

### **Advanced Personality Engine**
- **Behavioral conditioning** based on user feedback
- **Context-aware responses** with topic tracking
- **Personal lore system** for consistent character development
- **Dynamic personality adjustment** over time

### **Extensible Architecture**
- **WebSocket-based** event-driven system
- **Plugin-ready tool system** for easy extension
- **Real-time dashboard** for monitoring and interaction
- **Production-ready** with batching and scaling support
