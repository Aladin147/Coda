- **16GB+ System RAM** (32GB recommended for optimal performance)
- **CUDA 12.8+** with PyTorch nightly builds
- **Windows 10/11** or **Linux** (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Aladin147/Coda.git
cd Coda

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install PyTorch nightly with CUDA 12.8 (RTX 5090 support)
pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128

# Install Coda dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies (optional)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Set up environment configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Verify installation
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch: {torch.__version__}, CUDA: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

# Start Coda with default configuration
python -m coda.cli

# Start with WebSocket dashboard (recommended)
python -m coda.cli --dashboard

# Start with custom configuration
python -m coda.cli --config configs/production.yaml

# Run system validation
python scripts/validate_system.py

# Run comprehensive demo
python scripts/comprehensive_demo.py
```
