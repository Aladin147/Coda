# Migration Guide to Coda

This guide helps you migrate from traditional voice assistants and AI systems to Coda's integrated platform.

## Overview

Coda represents a significant advancement over traditional voice assistants by providing:

- **Local-first processing** with privacy protection
- **Integrated memory system** that learns and remembers
- **Adaptive personality** that evolves with usage
- **Extensible tool ecosystem** for complex tasks
- **Real-time voice processing** with sub-second latency
- **Multi-modal capabilities** (voice, text, future vision)

## Migration Scenarios

### From Traditional Voice Assistants

#### Amazon Alexa / Google Assistant Migration

**What you're used to:**
```
User: "Alexa, what's the weather?"
Alexa: "It's 72 degrees and sunny in your location."
```

**With Coda:**
```
User: "What's the weather like?"
Coda: "It's 72°F and sunny today. Perfect weather for that morning jog you mentioned yesterday!"
```

**Key Differences:**
- **Memory**: Coda remembers your preferences and past conversations
- **Context**: Responses are personalized based on your history
- **Privacy**: All processing happens locally, no cloud dependency
- **Extensibility**: You can add custom tools and integrations

#### Migration Steps:

1. **Install Coda**:
   ```bash
   git clone <coda-repo>
   cd coda
   pip install -e ".[voice]"
   ```

2. **Configure Voice Processing**:
   ```yaml
   # configs/migration.yaml
   voice:
     enabled: true
     mode: "adaptive"
     wake_words: ["hey coda", "coda"]
   ```

3. **Import Existing Data** (if available):
   ```python
   # Import preferences from other systems
   await memory_manager.store_memory(
       content="User prefers morning weather updates",
       memory_type=MemoryType.PREFERENCE
   )
   ```

### From OpenAI API / ChatGPT

#### API-based Chat Migration

**What you're used to:**
```python
import openai

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
)
```

**With Coda:**
```python
from coda import Coda

coda = Coda()
await coda.initialize()

response = await coda.chat(
    message="Hello",
    include_memory=True,
    include_personality=True
)
```

**Key Differences:**
- **Stateful Conversations**: Coda maintains conversation context automatically
- **Memory Integration**: Past interactions inform current responses
- **Personality**: Responses adapt to your communication style
- **Local Processing**: Option for local LLMs (Ollama) or cloud APIs

#### Migration Steps:

1. **Replace API Calls**:
   ```python
   # Before (OpenAI)
   def chat_with_ai(message):
       response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
           model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
           messages=[{"role": "user", "content": message}]
       )
       return response.choices[0].message.content
   
   # After (Coda)
   async def chat_with_coda(message):
       response = await coda.chat(message)
       return response.content
   ```

2. **Migrate Conversation History**:
   ```python
   # Import existing conversation data
   for message in conversation_history:
       await coda.memory_manager.store_memory(
           content=message["content"],
           memory_type=MemoryType.EPISODIC,
           metadata={"timestamp": message["timestamp"]}
       )
   ```

### From Custom Voice Solutions

#### Speech-to-Text + LLM + Text-to-Speech Migration

**Traditional Pipeline:**
```
Audio → STT → LLM → TTS → Audio
```

**Coda Pipeline:**
```
Audio → Hybrid Processing (Moshi + LLM) → Audio
      ↓
   Memory Storage & Learning
      ↓
   Personality Adaptation
```

**Migration Benefits:**
- **Reduced Latency**: Direct speech-to-speech processing
- **Better Quality**: Hybrid approach combines speed and intelligence
- **Automatic Learning**: System improves without manual tuning
- **Integrated Context**: Memory and personality enhance responses

#### Migration Steps:

1. **Replace STT/TTS Pipeline**:
   ```python
   # Before (Traditional)
   def process_voice(audio_data):
       text = stt_service.transcribe(audio_data)
       response = llm_service.generate(text)
       audio = tts_service.synthesize(response)
       return audio
   
   # After (Coda)
   async def process_voice_coda(audio_data):
       response = await voice_manager.process_voice_input(
           conversation_id=conversation_id,
           audio_data=audio_data
       )
       return response.audio_data
   ```

2. **Migrate Audio Processing Settings**:
   ```yaml
   # Map your existing audio settings
   audio:
     sample_rate: 16000  # Your existing rate
     channels: 1         # Mono/stereo
     format: "wav"       # Your format
     enable_vad: true    # Voice activity detection
   ```

```python
# Before: Simple OpenAI chat
import openai

def simple_chat(message):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": message}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# After: Coda chat with memory and personality
from coda import Coda

async def enhanced_chat(message):
    coda = Coda()
    await coda.initialize()
    
    response = await coda.chat(
        message=message,
        include_memory=True,
        include_personality=True,
        include_tools=True
    )
    return response.content
```

### Voice Processing Migration

```python
# Before: Traditional voice pipeline
import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3

def traditional_voice_chat():
    r = sr.Recognizer()
    tts = pyttsx3.init()
    
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        audio = r.listen(source)
    
    text = r.recognize_google(audio)
    response = process_with_llm(text)
    
    tts.say(response)
    tts.runAndWait()

# After: Coda voice processing
from coda.components.voice import VoiceManager

async def coda_voice_chat():
    voice_manager = VoiceManager()
    await voice_manager.initialize()
    
    conversation_id = await voice_manager.start_conversation()
    
    # Process audio directly
    response = await voice_manager.process_voice_input(
        conversation_id=conversation_id,
        audio_data=audio_data
    )
    
    # Response includes both text and audio
    return response
```
